This repository is for the Intro to Robotics Final Project.

## For Dr. Becker

Hello, we hope you and your family are well. This GitHub repository is divided into two folders:
- Original OWI Arm Arduino Sketch and custom Pose Estimation library
- UR3 Arm Computer Vision and Robot Control Python Program

Thank you for allowing us to work on this project. We are grateful to implement PID Control, DH Parameters, Inverse Kinematics, Computer Vision, and other topics learned in class to a real-world application.
